## Forms

tags in forms are important. A lot of time the design has you tracking where peices of information are to feed back into the database. For constructor functions you should initialize this.state.vale so it renders with data in there. Other options include:

<select> : creates a dropdown list of <options> nested within
<input type='file' /> : input for the user to upload a file. Uncontrolled

For ES6 you can update state with [source](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

                this.setState({
                    [name]: value
                });
