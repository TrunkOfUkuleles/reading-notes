### Questions

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
    React is a SPA design, so everything is rendered off of one HTML root

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
    Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
        outside of the browser router would put you high up in the site archetecture on the index.js. YOu would be app level, but not have access to the routing methods
    Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
        This gives you access to most of the app, but stioll witin the browser itself
    Inside a <Route />
        Specific to the route itself
