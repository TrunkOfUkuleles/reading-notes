### QUESTIONS

1. Write the following steps in the correct order:
    Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
    Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
    Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
    Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
    Receive authorization code
    Make a request to the access token endpoint
    Receive access token
 

2. What can you do with an authorization code?
    the code is used to confirm who you are at login, and use that as a basis of generating an access token. 

3. What can you do with an access token?
    as long as the signature remains accepted, it gives any requests to the server the access you have. 

4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
    simple and hooks into services that people already use. Take the onus of security off of you a bit

### Vocabulary

Client ID: public id of user for auth
Client Secret: privite identifyer that can house app credentials
Authentication Endpoint: place to authenticate the token sent in the request
Access Token Endpoint: generation of token
API Endpoint: where api calls are sent
Authorization Code: code generated by auth for use generation token
Access Token: local storage (cookie) with the codes needed to be sent in requests to the server

## Preview

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    tokens, authorization, 
Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    want to see the shape of the call more to get it down. 
What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    getting this up an d running with a test suite


### JWT - JSON Web Token

  open standard. securly transfer information between two bodies, and it is signed as secure. Very fast and flexible transmission - containing everything you would need about user

## signed Tokens
    all about that integrity. Include JWT with user requests so that you can have the correct access without querying the db for the user each time. 

## JWT FORM

Header.Payload.Signature
    Header - token type (JWT) and the algo being used, then it is base-64 rencoded.
