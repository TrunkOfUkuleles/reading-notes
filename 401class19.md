### Questions

1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server 
    It handles a lot of the nitty grtitty in terms of making sure the event listeners line up. It acts as the routing for a site. 
2. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
    relational (SQL?), key-value, in-memory, document (mongo/dynamodb?), wide column, graph, time series, and ledger
3. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    standard Queue for programming (what the V8 engine runs on) is a first in, last out
4. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    depending on the design you can have the server and client do a final handshake on reciept. 


### Vocab

Serverless API - api structure that is relatively platform agnostic
Triggers - event to fire a lambda
Dynamo vs Mongo - dynamo is the AWS cloud tuned versiuon of MongoDB
Dynamoose vs Mongoose - similar relationship, this library has a lot of built in commands for the database for easier readability
