## Stack

Both utilize an object called a node that tracks a value, and a reference to the next node in the list

  - push - add a node to the front list
  - pop - remopve node from the head of the list
  - top = top (head) of the stack
  - peek = get the value of the head of the list (or the one bellow?)
  - isEmpty - checks if there is at least one node in the list. 


  ## FILO
    First in, Last out. the order which the program handles the linked list. The head is the first element of the liust, but the traversal has the add/remove point be at the end

  ## LIFO
    Same idea but When you add to a list it add to the end, and popping will take the element from the head, and make the next node the head. 

    # Push
       If you are putting to the head, then it is a simple O(1).

    # Peek
        only see's the tope, so real fast O(1)



    ## Queue

    enqueue - add node to the end of the LL
    dequeue - take the element from the head, and reassign the head
    front  - top
    rear - back
    peek - see the value of the top
    

    Queues are FIFO
