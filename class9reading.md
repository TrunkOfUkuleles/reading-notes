### Refactoring

Readability on modern coding is still difficult. One was to help alleviate this is to start refactoring bits of code. This has teh benefit of shortening file lengths, ads well as allow debugging to go a lot quicker as you aree building tools to be used multiple time. It is also very important to keep that simplification to produce code that does not repeate itself - stay DRY. One thing I did not know to look out for is checking Web APIs before breaking down the code more.
