### Questions

1. Why is access control important? 
    the selective restriction of access or information based upon an access level. System of organization and security.

2. Describe an application that would need access control.
    The web browser uses the environment to help keep things regular.

3. What is a role used for?
    A role is the security level/list of actions availible to a user in an ACL.

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
    The changes are made in a central location and are easily read by all parts of the program

### Vocab

Authorization - the process of giving someone a set of permissions for actions

Role Based Access Control - security system where users are given different roles, and the system will seemlessly provide the resources needed  without exposing the system any more than that.

Capabilities - List of actions / clearence level referenced by an ACL system

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    EvenEmitter 
What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    EvenEmitter - and what the more modern solutions look like in the face of frameworks like react. 

    

## Event Driven Programming

    Logical pattern that acts as a environment to run programming to avoid collision. Biggest example is the webpage. when you click , it is creating an event with listeners to respond. The basic concept uses an event handler (callback) and a main loop listening for any event triggers to trigger a callback. 

# EventEmitter
    A module that can "emmit" an event so tagging and linking becomes way morecustomizable. Not the fastest, but there are newer solutions.

# Removing Listeners
    Either for performance or memory leakage, removing listeners is important. the removeListener from Emmit can remove a listener (by it's name), because it won't be garbage collected even if the event has passed. Remember to name handlers rather than leaving them anonymous so you can clean up later. Otherwise you would have to write the cleanup in the event object itself.
