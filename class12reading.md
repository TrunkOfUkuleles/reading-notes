### SQL

Structured Query Language. SELECT id,name,price FROM products basic commands. Get, Put etc

 good for tables. Product tables, etc. Very strict requirements and how they are entered

 ## Schima
 fields(columns)
 records(rows)

 all entries share the same schema - even if they are empty. Use multiople relational tables that are all doing information processing to get info from many different APIs. YOU can have tables setting relations between other tables to give complexity to a rigid data struicture. 

 ## Many-to-many one-to-one
 Types of relations. Where a record has a single master id to track across the system (121). for a system where products are assignmed cretor ids we have a tracking system where one user has a single id, but can be a parent of multiple products (12many). multiple roles and ids need a user role s master table to track the matches - many to many is complicated.
