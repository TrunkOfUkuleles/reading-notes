### Questions

1. Does a deployed React application require a server?
    deployed as in run? no. Deployed as in hosted independantly, then yes - but it does not need a db. 
2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
    abstraction added to TDD. collaborative process where the app is tested via a wide variety of people with a common understanding of the expectations of how the act should behave. Tends to require a domain-specific language as specialized software.
3. What does npm run build do?
    compiles your app into a html file for a compiled version for quicker launch. 
4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
    in a public folder, an index.html file contains the pasic structure for the browsers to refer to. From there, a JS index file hooks into the Root element in the html base, and runs an app file rendering in that space. Once built and started, the js is rendered into html, extending as a child of the root

### Vocab

BDD - Behavior Driven Developement
Acceptance Tests - set of automated test to ensure a basic level of stability for acceptance
mounting - bringing in a file/library/data
build - the act of compiling into a more easily rendered format - HTML --> chunks and no-spaced.
