### Questions

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
    toolkit simplifies some of the basic actions most systems need (including the tools to monitor state). Ducks looks more like a database schema that adheres to similar logic to redux, wit hsome naming conventions

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
    simple at the start, allowing for more agile initial deployment

                
### Vocab
redux toolkit slices - A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. a built in function that takes an object to generate actions tied to state.

namespace - not in JS by default. providing scope to identifiers, holding data naming to prevent collisions
