### Questions

1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component? 
    Generally you would hous ethe state in the parent, but you can also pass a functioin that can pass back the state.
2. What can be passed along in a prop variable?
    just about anything? Object?
3. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
    it will reflect the appropriate state in the parent, and can reflect that information down if you build it that way
