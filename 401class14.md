### Questions

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    A FIFO has a rigid rule about dequeueing

2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    the handshake protoicol tends to include a response object with a status attached. 

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
    a transaction or real time exchange is a good example of seeing the design patter generated from events

4. How do you test an event driven system?
    having an automated system generating events and see if the loggs show the different parts are responding as needed. 


### Vocab

FIFO Queue - data strcuture that enforces the first in first out - maybe limiting tail editing or accessing the middle?
Pub/Sub - the on/emit system of connecting a socket subscribes, and emit is a publish.


### Preview

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    FIFO, SNS, SQS

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    getting the sense for hoiw to approach systems like sns vs sqs quickly so it is not something I need to stress over. 

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    seeing how the emit functioncan be combined with a FIFO queue using SQS modeling on different layers. 


### Simple notification service vs Simple Queueing Service

SNS: pub/sub system. sends out to subs
SQS: Queueing service for message processing. system pust poll queue to habndle changes - not automated. processed by a single consumer. 

DO OTHER SYSTEMS CARE ABOUT AN EVENT? - use SNS

DOES YOUR  SYSTEM CARE ABOUT AN EVENT - use SQS
