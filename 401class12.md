### Questions

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
    regular shape and consistancy, and ability to transfer on lower bandwidth channels. 

2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
    User Datagram Protocol is designed to allow for quick communication where a request is not needed before information can be sent. 

3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
    yes, but each server socket listend in a single port. 

4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
    as long as it is paired with unique client side IP/PORT?

5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
    if yopu REEEEAAAALLLLLY want to.


### Vocab

Observer Pattern - software design where a object (Subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) to update as related states change
Listener - a running call that will trigger if an event of the chosen name is activated, to then run a snippet of code
Event Handler - the callback that performs the code when an event happens. 
Event Driven Programming - programming style where you build off of the structure of events you want to be the flow for the app. 
Event Loop - under the hood process of how the engine handles actions that are starting to stack up (or Queue)
Event Queue - the ordering for actions in reaction to events, when they must be executed in a particular order
Call Stack - the JS engine stack that handles execution contexts and function handling. 
Emit/Raise/Trigger - methods on the events.... to cause an artificial event to occur oin command. 
Subscribe - establishing a connection with a web app that allows for real time updating.
database - store for information that should not be widely visible. 

### Preview

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    Emit, observer pattern, socket.io
Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    how this informatioon is handled and transfered. 
What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
   the real time aspect and how easy - fiddly it is once it is up. 

    

### Web Socket

                const socket = new WebSocket('ws://game.example.com:12010/updates');
                socket.onopen = function () {
                    setInterval(function() {
                        if (socket.bufferedAmount == 0)
                        socket.send(getUpdateData());
                    }, 50);
                };

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

communications protocol, like HTML, but it provides full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. For what we think of as modern web design - "live" apps that track and update state automatically during use - Web Socket is key. It has a much lower overhead than HTML, and allows for a connection to stay open to pass information back and foth as needed without an explicit call to the server for every action. 


### Socket.[IO](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/socket.io_quick_guide.htm) 
    JS library for real-time web applications. enables bidirectional communication between the client and server in real time. The client library runs the browser, and the server side helps with a library for Node.js - covering both ends. to be a 'real-time' app, it must feel or function immediately, or with a sense of keeping curent. Thing like messengers, push notifications and anything a little more interactive and timing focused. There are a lot of event handlers that help map out the sort of interactions possible, along with systems for 'subscribing' to an event for when it is 'broadcast'.
