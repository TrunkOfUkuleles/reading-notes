### [Solving Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

                -- Read the problem completely twice. 
                -- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data. 
                -- Optimize the manual steps. -- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code. 
                -- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code. 
                -- Optimize the real code.

## As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3

start practicing going through the steps manually before getting to pseudo code

actually pseudocode! And start thinking in functions- break up big problems into smaller solutions

### 1 Hour = $1000

this is where I get to freestyle because I am bored. The concept of putting a price tag on "time" in your life is such a fucking backwards way to
look at things (note: it is an effective societal view to maximize profits and that's about it). My point really being if we start looking at 
work/time/effort in relation to our target of life balance, most people are really in a place where that number should be a hell of a lot 
closer to that thousand vs the paltry $15 we have been arguing over. That being said, tech offer a level of training outside of straight college 
degree that affords a bit more leverage. Depending on where you want to go in, your "labor" value could easily far exceed $1000/hr. Especially
if you factor in whatever inflated potential for profit we like to play with before anything actually gets built. 


### 5 Whys

Gotta love Japanese Business culture/myth. He always loved walking the floor so he can better understand the problem. So it was a mix of being present and communicating clearly with people along the chain. Systematizing that to delve into at least a 5 factorial to find the root of the problem. Similar to how you can section off pieces of your code to see where the information is being lost.



## [the list](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
