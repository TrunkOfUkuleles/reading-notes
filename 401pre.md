### [Solving Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

-- Read the problem completely twice.
-- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
-- Optimize the manual steps.
-- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
-- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
-- Optimize the real code.

# As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3

start practicing going through the staps manually befo9re getting to psudo code

actually psudocode! And start thinking in functionamitizing - break up big problems into smaller solutions

### 1 Hour = $1000

this is where i get to frestyle because I am bored. The concept of putting a price tag on "time" in your life is such a fucking backwards way to
look at things (note: it is an effective sociatal view to maximize profits and that's about it). My point really being if we start looking at 
work/time/effort in relation to our target of life balance, most people are really in a place where that number should be a hell of a lot 
closer to that thousand vs the paltry 15 we have been arguing over. That being said, tech offer a level of training outside of straight college 
degree that affords a bit more leverage. Depending on where you want to go in, your "labor" value could easily far exceed $1000/hr. Especially
if you factor in whatever inflated potential for profit we like to play with before anything actually gets built. 


### 5 Whys

Gotta love Japanese Bussiness culture/myth. He always loved walking the floor so he can better understand the problem. So it was a mix
of being present and communicating clearly with people along the chain. Systimitizing that to delve into at least a 5 factorial to find 
the root of the problem. Similar to how you can section off peieces of your code to see where the information is being lost.

1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
Step 5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
